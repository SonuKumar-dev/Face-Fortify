Pyrebase (for Firebase integration)
Tkinter (for the user interface)
AES encryption (for folder security)
Threading (for parallel processing)
Features:
Registration of user's face for secure folder access.
Real-time face verification using facial recognition techniques.
AES encryption to lock and unlock folders based on user verification.
Integration with Firebase for image storage.
Responsibilities:
Implemented the user interface using Tkinter for an intuitive user experience.
Utilized OpenCV and Dlib for face detection and recognition.
Integrated Firebase for image storage and retrieval.
Implemented AES encryption for folder security.
Designed a secure and responsive system that enhances data protection and user privacy.
