# Face-Fortify
Facial Biometric Authentication System to lock folders or files

### Description: 
Developed the "Face Fortify" project, an application that combines face recognition and folder encryption for enhanced security. The system registers and verifies users' faces, allowing them to lock and unlock folders securely.
### Technologies and Skills:
Python
OpenCV (for image processing)
Dlib (for face detection and recognition)
Pyrebase (for Firebase integration)
Tkinter (for the user interface)
AES encryption (for folder security)
Threading (for parallel processing)

## Features:
- Registration of user's face for secure folder access.
- Real-time face verification using facial recognition techniques.
- AES encryption to lock and unlock folders based on user verification.
- Integration with Firebase for image storage.
